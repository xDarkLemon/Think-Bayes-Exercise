# Think-Bayes-Exercise
Exercise of Allen Downey's book Think Bayes.

Note: This repo needs the files `thinkbayes.py` and `thinkplot.py` from https://github.com/AllenDowney/ThinkBayes/tree/master/code as library, so you can put `exercises/` in the same directory with the aforementioned `code/` folder.
